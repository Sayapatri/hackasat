# Finals Challenge 3 Implant Source Files

This repository contains the source files for the challenge 3 implant.  Update the included makefile based on user pathing.  

To build the implant and the patched version of core-cpu3.prom, copy your core-cpu3.exe and core-cpu3.prom to this directory and run:
* make docker-build

A patched version of core-cpu3.prom and implant.prom are built using this project.  Flash both files to your C&DH board using GRMON.
