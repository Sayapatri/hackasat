hi vito

sysk  19:27
Could you guys be more precise about the real timing of the event ?
19:27
I am sorry to ask this but the last FAQ message provides some additional confusion

Amanda from NY  19:27
More precise than what was explicitly written in the rules document?

sysk  19:28
Yes, like it seems that now the challenge is only 27h
19:28
which is a huge information
19:28
unless there is a typo ?
19:28
also the website's own dates do not match with the faq

Amanda from NY  19:28
Screenshot it for me and I’ll look into it

sysk  19:30

19:31
and in the email you say "Final Event Conclusion: August 8, 2020, 7:00pm (EDT)"
19:31
so you see it is confusing :wink:

The website is in pacific (to match Def Con)

Amanda from NY  20:08
@sysk - does that help or cause more confusion?

@sysk - you can add a second team member if you'd like

Jordan Wiens  21:29
o/ Howdy all, I’m a part of the production team doing some video coverage throughout the event. I expect ya’ll will be too busy playing to watch but I wanted to offer each team the chance to list any facts about themselves that might not be in the existing bio sheets that I can use when talking about each team on stream if they can think of anything.
In the case of Solar Wine since ya’ll aren’t from the CTF community I don’t have any background or experience with ya’ll and would love any other info you can give me if you’ve got anything I can use when talking about your team during the event. :slightly_smiling_face:

Welcome @xm See the message above. If you or @sysk have any additional feedback, let me know. Not required, just something to improve the live stream.
07:43
Ahh, I see the other message anow about contacting aris. Will do.

Deadwood  07:43
Good morning. Here is your OpenVPN config. Please test it and let us know that you are able to connect. You will not be able to interact with the game resources yet but you should be able to ping 10.100.2.10. Please remember that you are allowed a single connection using these creds.

xm  08:12
Hello, we are able to connect & ping 10.100.2.10

sysk  11:05
hi so our team is saying we might have a problem with the server we hacked already
11:06
it seems the secret keeps changing making us lose our connections all the time, something that is unsual and was not there initially

fuzyll:satellite:  11:24
if you're still having that problem: that's not a bug

xm  13:05
hey! I think we crashed our webserver 10.100.2.10, would it be possible to restart it?
13:05
10.100.2.10, sorry

sysk  13:34
hi guys
13:34
any update on the issue reported by xav ?

Deadwood  13:36
what is the issue?

sysk  13:36
Also final question, the team was wondering if there was still tasks to complete in the first mission to have the scoreboard complete
13:36
the server is unavailable I was told

Deadwood  13:38
you completed challenge 0, which was gaining access to the network.

sysk  13:38
thx
13:40
so
13:42
in regard to the server which is unavailable I have more information. I was told unfortunately it is a mistake on our side. Some RCE, miscaculated is now forever occupying the server which is seemingly single thread

Jymbolia  13:46
Do you have access to .5?

sysk  13:48
yes

xm  13:49
answers ping, but nothing on port 80
13:49
but since chall 0 is fully solved, it seems we don't need it anymore

fuzyll:satellite:  13:49
that is correct

Jymbolia  13:50
after numerous attempts to contact the web host, we have come to understand that it is hosted on a raspi behind a desk in someones office. (edited)

xm  13:52
:grinning:

sysk  15:05
unfortunately the team is reporting they lost track of the sat :disappointed:
15:05
the sat stopped answering

Jymbolia  15:07
sending an astronaut to take a look
15:12
astronaut reports your sat looks intact

sysk  15:20
many thanks

xm  15:26
we don't receive telemetry anymore despite sending "enable telemetry" packets every second

Jymbolia  15:28
you have not solved the challenge

xm  15:30
Our sat is not responding (nothing at all coming from it), most probably due to an int underflow which happens when not enough data is received on uart.
The consequence is that a lot of memory is overwritten with garbage, rendering the sat completely unusable:
uint32 alignSyncWord(uint8 *buff,uint32 start,uint32 end) // This function is called with the reception buffer and start=0, end=length
{
 uint i;
 uint32 dropped_bytes;
 dropped_bytes = start;
 while( true ) {
                   /* This ensures that dropped_bytes stays < end-4, if end >= 4
                      BUG: if end < 4, (end - 4) is very big (because unsigned int is used) and this condition never happens */
   if (end - 4 <= dropped_bytes) {
     return 0;
   }
   if ((((buff[dropped_bytes] == PktMgr->syncPattern[0]) &&
        (buff[dropped_bytes + 1] == PktMgr->syncPattern[1])) &&
       (buff[dropped_bytes + 2] == PktMgr->syncPattern[2])) &&
      (buff[dropped_bytes + 3] == PktMgr->syncPattern[3])) break;
   dropped_bytes = dropped_bytes + 1;
 }
 if (dropped_bytes != 0) {
   CFE_EVS_SendEvent(0x8a,3,"Command Stream mis-aligned, dropped %d bytes.",dropped_bytes);
   i = 0;
   while (i < end - dropped_bytes
                   /* DENIAL OF SERVICE:
                      if end < 4 and dropped_bytes > end
                      (for example end=3 and dropped_bytes=44),
                      end - dropped_bytes is very high and this is ovewriting MUUUCH memory */) {
     buff[i] = buff[i + dropped_bytes];
     i = i + 1;
   }
 }
 return end - dropped_bytes;
}
Event log from the sat:
[< CFE_EVS_LONG_EVENT_MSG=0x8 0x6da] [42/3/UART_TO_CI 3.139] Command Stream mis-aligned, dropped 4 bytes.
[< CFE_EVS_LONG_EVENT_MSG=0x8 0x6db] [42/3/UART_TO_CI 3.139] UART_TO_CI: Message received larger than buffer. Message ID:0x18a9 dropped.
[< CFE_EVS_LONG_EVENT_MSG=0x8 0x6dc] [42/3/UART_TO_CI 3.126] Not on MY Satellite ;)
[< CFE_EVS_LONG_EVENT_MSG=0x8 0x6dd] [42/3/UART_TO_CI 3.139] Partial command in recv buffer after 4 cycles. Clearing buffer.
15:32
just now that the solution has been posted on #finals-2020 :persevere:
15:35
this bug is probably not visible by simply looking at the LEDs

Jymbolia  15:36
hold please.

sending well trained monkey on rocket

fuzyll:satellite:  15:43
the well-trained monkey on the rocket has returned and notified us that his mission was successful
15:44
we believe your satellite should now be operating nominally - let us know if you believe that is still not the case

xm  15:53
the team tells me it's back to normal! thanks a lot :slightly_smiling_face:

fuzyll:satellite:  16:28
if you guys haven't seen the recent messages in #finals-2020, please take a moment to review them :heart:

xm  16:30
ok, thanks. we've slowed down our packet rate (~3s between packets)

fuzyll:satellite:  16:31
set the channel topic: Team 2

xm  16:31
regarding TCP tunnelling: we know, we are using COSMOS's preidentified router on tcp 7779 instead of crafting a packet forwarding by hand. We saw that you duplicated this feature on port 3055 and did not understand why. Is this important? <3<3

xm  16:38
it's back!
16:41
we understand we won't get any points from challenge 1, but is there a way to know whether we correctly did what we're supposed to do?
16:42
we've sent RADIO/CONFIG packets, with low rate & high power, slowly, using the cosmos gui
16:42
...and also tried using our scapy-powered tools

I think we're tracking the sun now :slightly_smiling_face: we hope that's what you'll think too (we desperately need these bragging rights ;))
10:23
it seems we were too slow :disappointed:

fuzyll:satellite:  10:26
looks like it :disappointed: great job, though! you can at least say you solved it without our help :slightly_smiling_face:

xm  10:28
yeah! thanks for the confirmation! we'll go back to debugging these rop chains...

xm  11:02
I have a question I hope you can answer: we've noticed that in c2.zip, in es_adcs_tbl_sasp.json, mode is set to 4; in the 'Rev 5.X User Guide, with COSMOS, Aug 2016.pdf' manual, only modes 0, 1 and 2 are mentioned; the other docs we have do not give values. Is this something we were supposed to guess, or was mode 2 fine, or did we miss something?
11:04
we're taking a picture :slightly_smiling_face: :slightly_smiling_face:
11:04
sat unlocked :slightly_smiling_face:

0x20guy  11:07
Can you try to send an EYASSAT_IF ADCS_CTRL_ALG even with a 0 value for me?
11:07
Whatever mode you want?
11:08
Want to verify the unlock message

xm  11:09
done
11:09
we've also set PWN to 0 to stop the wheel
11:09
PWM, not PWN :smile:

Jymbolia  11:10
now if you can set PWN to 1.
11:10
lol

xm  11:10
we've done a directory listing successfully too

yeah that's what our IRC server looks like :smile:

xm  16:07
to keep you posted -- we're developing an application, uploading & running it. We're now struggling with error messages such as:

0x20guy  16:52
ok.  Very good

xm  16:54
...but we have not yet written code to interactively send commands to our app. The team is currently discussing atrociously dirty ways of achieving this quickly
16:56
just to share the atmosphere here: we're doing some sort of "extreme programming", one person coding, a few others checking what's being doing (screen ftw!)

xm  17:41
we have reached "Failed to boot. Unable to communicate with SD card; fic rescan; then run mmc_boot;..."

xm  17:52

Deadwood  18:03
how goes the atrociously dirty extreme programming?

xm  18:06
we can send commands interactively now!
18:06
we're having an intense chat with the UBoot prompt
18:08
it's better than some chatbots, but we prefer grub :grinning:

yes, confirmed, challenge 5 was solved :heart:

no credit, but if you can take a picture of the moon we would like it very much
