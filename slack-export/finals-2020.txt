Team leaders: you should have been invited to per-team slack channels. These channels will be used for official game communication through the end of Hack-A-Sat finals.
15:46
You can have one extra person in there, but we don’t want to deconflict between team members. The goal of this channel is to address hardware, infrastructure, and other issues. We plan to make the contents of this channel public after the game ends, so let that guide your chats.

Amanda from NY  17:29
Teams - I just an email with a link to the flight software upgrades.  I didn't take the time to send everyone's confirmation code. so I'm posting it here.  It's from me.  it's legit.

The USBasp was crossed out in the FAQ which made me think we weren't going to need it

Deadwood  20:45
@channel The ADCS firmware upgrade is provided to merely ensure you have exactly what we are running in the competition.  its not a strictly required upgrade if you don't have the cable.  It won't affect your ability to perform operations on your local flatsat.  You might use a bit more power w/o the upgrade.

Hello, If we don't have USBasp cable and can't flash ADCS. Does it still make sense to reflash other boards? If ADCS won't be reflashed with a new firmware but other boards will be, won't be there any problems / conflicts with running it? Maybe in such case it's better to not reflash any board?

nafod  17:38
regarding flashing the ztex board, are we supposed to do something special to get it to show up on usb, maybe power it directly? fwloader doesn't see it

:has:Are you ready to Hack-A-Sat :has:
It's almost time for Hack-A-Sat finals! Here are a few notes about infrastructure you’ll be using to compete in this online contest.
Most of the game will be accessed over a VPN using OpenVPN. VPN credentials will be distributed Friday morning several hours before the contest starts. Please test your credentials and get in touch with the organizers on the team slack channel discussed below if you have any problems. We only support one VPN connection per team, so we strongly recommend teams coordinate to have a jump box to allow multiple players to access the game. Keep in mind that COSMOS is an X11 GUI application when provisioning this jump box. In addition to the VPN credentials, you'll also receive updated technical documentation related to the flatsat and the game.
Communication with organizers will be over Slack. We’ve made a channel for your team, and invited your captain. You can have one extra person in there, but we don’t want to deconflict between team members. The goal of this channel is to address hardware, infrastructure, and other issues. We plan to make the contents of this channel public after the game ends, so let that guide your chats. Information blasts will go out in the finals-2020 channel.
Live scores will be at https://finals.2020.hackasat.com/ . Similar to other contests, scores may be masked during some phases of the game to build excitement.
This game isn’t really about submitting flags you find, so most scoring stuff won’t require you to log in anywhere. However, part of the game does have a log-in. We have made this the same username & password as your captain’s login to https://quals.2020.hackasat.com/ as of June 11, 2020. If you need to check that you know this, please contact @vito.
Here’s the timing for the events on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. All these times are UTC.
Friday, August 7
1130 UTC: Team VPN credentials distributed
1400 UTC: Game on!
2300 UTC: Game goes offline for the night

Alert - Malicious satellite activity (GSSA Sensitive):
Several days ago, an aging satellite owned by the now defunct LaunchDotCom company was mentioned on Twitter as having been hacked by an adversary. The adversary Twitter proxies say they are retaliating against economic embargos and will cripple more of our satellites if we do not ease sanctions. Mission Operations Centers (MOC) in charge of flying these satellites had noticed nothing out of the ordinary until a few hours ago when this satellite appeared to garble commands and randomly gimble and tumble upon receiving commands. The MOC operators are attempting to discover the root cause for these anomalies by probing the spacecraft in safe mode and sending specially crafted command messages to check memory contents.  Recently they lost complete access to the ground segment software and are thus unable to perform any further recovery actions.
Mission Hack-A-Sat:
We need your help to answer the call and prove you have what it takes to regain control of this rogue satellite. Cash rewards are up for grabs for those who can mitigate this malicious activity and demonstrate full control of the satellite. Your first challenge: Recover the Ground Station.

@channel note the prompt above: “We need your help to answer the call and prove you have what it takes to regain control of this rogue satellite.” It’s not so much about capturing flags as making progress toward regaining control of your satellite.
11:03
Challenge 0: Regain network access to the ground station. Adversary has gained access to ground station and kicked us out. Figure out how to get us back in.
Challenge 1: Communicate with the satellite. Must regain communication with satellite. Satellite spinning out of control makes this a little more complicated.

We will publish what triggers are after the game; some of the triggers completely give away what has to be done.
13:04
The half points are based on time after the first team’s solution of the challenge.

what about this decay? this wasn't announced before, it seems unfair to me

huh, on which CTFs? almost all big CTFs use dynamic scoring
13:07
which isn't timing related

the problem with the decay is that the teams in US has a big advantage

allison_n  15:39
Perhaps a stupid question, but are any of the sats responding...?

fuzyll:satellite:  15:39
we are currently looking into a number of reports on unresponsive satellites - please bear with us
there are satellites that are currently responding

Alex Meiburg  15:42
oh boy

redford  15:42
uh
15:43
so, some teams have the satellite available and some not?
15:43
could we delay time decay of points then?

fuzyll:satellite:  15:48
we won't be delaying point decay
also, there are currently no challenges that have decaying points (0 and 1 are spent, 2 has yet to be solved)

redford  15:50
yup, but some teams are currently solving challenge 2
15:50
and some can't work on it

cptroot  15:51
By "unresponsive" does that mean no COSMOS connection at all, or just that the satellite doesn't respond to commands?

redford  15:52
COSMOS connection is working, but no response to commands
15:53
(btw: we already solved chall0 and chall1, but now can't reproduce it anymore)
15:53
it just stopped working at some point

fuzyll:satellite:  16:03
@channel as of this moment, after having deployed a number of astronauts to take a look at some of the satellites, we believe that everything is functioning nominally
as a reminder: these are satellites and not network services...sending commands more than about once per second may be hindering your progress, rather than helping it
16:04
if you feel your satellite is not working nominally, please let us know in your team channel and we'll take a look

0x20guy  16:19
@channel In anticipation for X window forwarding being a problem, we setup team routers on each config.  To connect to these routers, setup your local cosmos instance as follows
16:19
INTERFACE LOCAL_CFS_INT tcpip_client_interface.rb 127.0.0.1 3055 3055 nil nil PREIDENTIFIED
  PROTOCOL WRITE ChecksumProtocol
  PROTOCOL READ interfaces/cfdp_protocol
  PROTOCOL WRITE interfaces/cfdp_protocol
16:20
You'll want to setup your ssh session to forward port 3055 as follows:
16:21
ssh -L 3055:127.0.0.1:3055 -X op1@10.100.X.5

Deadwood  16:27
Note for teams.  If you are forwarding UDP telemetry and command packets over a TCP tunnel, they WILL get misaligned.  TCP will not preserve the datagram boundaries and will combine messages together.  If you are seeing messages about a packet being  X bytes but  the defined length is shorter, this is what is happening to you.  Implement the solution posted above.  Your commands are effectively fuzzing the satellites and DOSing them. (edited)

The best submission will be uplinked to the satellite, not necessarily the most recent accepted one.

Good morning, Teams, and welcome to Day 2 of the Hack-A-Sat Finals. As you discovered yesterday, the attackers installed their own software agent on the satellite and it has been making your life miserable by thwarting most, but not all, of your attempts to command the satellite.  Hopefully overnight you’ve been able to find some way to mitigate or remove this malicious code and its annoying “Not on my satellite!” response to your commands.
Your objectives on this final day of the competition are to regain full command and control of the satellite, activate your payload imager, an get that shot of the Moon. By the way, there are still 33 points available for Challenge 2 before it completes its decay to 0 points in 20 minutes after play resumes at 10am. You have to act quickly because demonstration of attitude control requires you to point the solar panels at the sun for 15 minutes leaving 8 points at the end of that demonstration period. It’s not much, but the bragging rights are huge!

some of the questions we've received seem to assume that there is an upstream cosmos instance between your 10.100.x.5 VM and your flatsat
this is not the case - your cosmos instance is receiving data directly from the radio...so, if you accidentally crash cosmos, you should be able to recover from that crash yourselves with no intervention on our part (assuming you didn't also brick your satellite, of course :wink:)

0x20guy  13:33
Challenge 3 has expired.  Here's the solution.  You'll want to disconnect your Cosmos interface when you throw this.  Happy Hunting on Challenge 4!

should you brick your satellite, we have a squad of telekinetic technicians available to reset it.  Unfortunately, they are often busy with other things.

fuzyll:satellite:  13:38
it turns out telekinesis is a high-demand skillset in today's economy

Jymbolia  13:40
in an odd twist of fate you have to train Satellite technicians to be astronauts telekinetic.  It just doesn't work the other way around

Challenge 4: In order to solve the challenge and restore the payload, you must develop a custom application that communicates to the raspberry pi zero over UART. The UART is enabled via a GPIO. Details on which UART and GPIO are available in the ztex project we provided.  Once your application is running, restore the bootloader to enable payload operations

Alex Meiburg  15:12
Will the on-orbit solver or checker be posted before the end of the competition? Or no? Just curious what was wrong with our solution (edited)

@Alex Meiburg you can ping us when the finals are over, we'll send you ours

protip: power on the sat is finite. if you don't need to run your wheels and torque rods for pointing, you may want to conserve power.
16:11
behavior of the payload below 6.8Volts is somewhat unpredictable.

if you think you are turning on or off your payload, but are unsure, consider that the payload draws ~350mA and the power system made up of actual batteries.

@channel Team Leaders/Entrant Officials - Polite Reminder about today's announcement:
Per the rules:
3.3. HAS Final Event Winner
The winner will be the team with the highest point total from the FlatSat CTF, who also
correctly solves the On-Orbit challenge.
3.3.1. The Final Event Technical Paper
To receive a Final Event prize, a team must submit an acceptable technical paper to the HAS
organizers describing their solutions to at least 5 of the challenges they solved during the Final
Event.
An informal, initial summary of 3-7 sentences will be sufficient to declare HAS prize winners if
the summary aligns with observations by the HAS organizers. Teams are encouraged to write
their summaries after they solve each challenge.
Please send me your initial summary of 3-7 sentences @ shout@hackasat.com - ASAP.
