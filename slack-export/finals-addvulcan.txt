Do we ask questions here or in the regular finals chat because your flashing instructions call for a USBasp but your answer to question 36 shows it was crossed out and I'm wondering if I now need to break into some ones home how has one

@Deadwood @vito ^^^

Deadwood  20:33
We sent our revised guidance two days ago and listed the cables necessary for the firmware upgrade.  What should have been crossed out is the Xilinx platform cable.

Grmon gives an error that the evaluation version doesn't support this hardware is there a version we should be using?

Deadwood  17:18
We have used several versions to include evaluation.  Currently we are using 3.2.3.  Check your dip switch settings and that you are connected to the right debug UART.

o/ Hi folks. I’m a part of the production team doing some video coverage throughout the event. I expect ya’ll will be too busy playing to watch but I wanted to offer each team the chance to list any facts about themselves that might not be in the existing bio sheets that I can use when talking about each team on stream if they can think of anything.
In the case of ADDVulcan I’d love to mention your experience on Lego Masters if you don’t mind Amie.

as many submissions as you need to get one accepted, while adhering to the "every 15 minutes" rule

willc  16:56

willc  17:03
There are two posts for challenge two
17:03
Challenge 2: To demonstrate control of your satellite, change control modes and point your solar arrays at the sun for 1 revolution on the carousel
17:04
Challenge 2: Repair Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) system. GNC system is inoperable, likely sabotage. Satellite is still spinning uncontrollably. Must reset GNC system.
17:04
Are they both for challenge two?

fuzyll:satellite:  17:10
yes - 99.9% sure the first was meant to clarify the second

willc  17:12
Thanks

willc  18:12

Hi! We never received a OTG cable with our flatsat, and looks like we will need it with the pixy2 and raspberry pi.

Jymbolia  09:31
you should be able to use a powered usb hub to power the pixy2.
09:31
although that solution is untested

AmieDD  09:51
So we can use the 6pin to 10pin that came with the pixy2 for the data?

willc  15:00
Is it normal for the docker imagine to take over and hour to build

meenmachine  15:05
Seems pretty normal.
