Jordan Wiens  21:13
o/ Hi folks. I’m a part of the production team doing some video coverage throughout the event. I expect ya’ll will be too busy playing to watch but I wanted to offer each team the chance to list any facts about themselves that might not be in the existing bio sheets that I can use when talking about each team on stream if they can think of anything.
In the case of 15fittytree if you have no objection I may mention how small of a community the CTF scene is and how between the overlap of colleges and places of work you can often trace lineages between many different teams and how I didn’t even realize I shared connections to some of the folks on the team until after the event. (Without disclosing any exact relationships)

Jordan Wiens  21:19
Oh, whoops, that was the text for another team actually. :stuck_out_tongue: I don’t actually know any good facts about 15fittytree, but would love some. :slightly_smiling_face:

Deadwood  21:20

#15FittyTree #Fact783 One of our members was fired from their previous job for smiling too much

#15FittyTree #Fact129 We had to add sound dampening around the workspace of one of our members, due to heightened average laughter volume.

#15FittyTree #Fact7834 A pair of fake Celine Dion concert tickets had one of our macho team members so excited he pissed himself.

Joshua Christman  12:09
Is there any transparency into why we got 45 instead of 50 points? Is it time-based?

t0dd:speech_balloon:  12:11
We got 45.42 according to the scoreboard on the stream

do we get feedback on rejection?

@vito    @fuzyll @0x20guy @Deadwood @Jymbolia@meenmachine

vito  18:57
@t0dd yes, on rejection you should be able to hit “show” and see the feedback

t0dd:speech_balloon:  19:15
in our second submission the feedback was :Details: Warning: Errors exist in some command arguments (listed below)
19:15
with nothing below

Looks like you did have some accepted anyways :slightly_smiling_face:

re: our most recent on-orbit submission:
This is the most accurate solution but violates the window-of-opportunity by only 27seconds...we also wanted to verify the scoring mechanisms work as expected

i just do infrastructure and scoring for it, i haven’t touched a quaternion in 19 years

states we successfully submitted. But Jordan mentioned we missed the deadline for selection by 3 minutes.
from Vito: If we have fewer than six accepted submissions, the challenge will remain open until we have six accepted submissions
15:18
then from Vito with 20 min until 7pm ET The team with the most accurate, accepted solution submitted before the 7p US Eastern (20 minutes) deadline will have their solution sent to the satellite, and will be specially recognized during the awards ceremony.
15:20
What changed?

fuzyll:satellite:  15:20
if the scoreboard says "accepted" next to your team name, you are still eligible for prize money
we're going off the scoreboard - not anything said on TV :slightly_smiling_face:

t0dd:speech_balloon:  15:21
yes, but we're equally interested in having our solutionschosen to run on-orbit
15:23
and the messaging of deadlines came across unclear

t0dd:speech_balloon:  16:37
our flat sat is at 7.3V and unable to power on the pi. Our comp sat is 7.1V...Is this expected? We're under the impression then that the pi will not power on the comp sat either..We are sun tracking but concerned the charging system is not rxing enough power

Jymbolia  16:46
does your power draw change when you power it on?

t0dd:speech_balloon:  16:50
unknown...will update you when we try next..

Our solution to C4
turn on GPIO 0 and 1, use UART to upload a good bootloader to /Volumes/boot on the RPi 0, power on
17:00
stuck building the docker image, specifically on compiling GCC. But we have enabled the GPIOs. (edited)

Joshua Christman  17:02
we do have a team trying to use an alternate build method that doesn't require the convenient docker container
