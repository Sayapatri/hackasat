@Bool you can add a second team member if you'd like

Jordan Wiens  21:27
Yo, bool, sorry for the impersonal boiler plate, similar is going to all teams. :wink:
o/ Howdy all, I’m a part of the production team doing some video coverage throughout the event. I expect ya’ll will be too busy playing to watch but I wanted to offer each team the chance to list any facts about themselves that might not be in the existing bio sheets that I can use when talking about each team on stream if they can think of anything.
In the case of Samurai I’m thinking of mentioning the fact that there is often movement between teams in the CTF community and how I’ve both played on and played /against/ Samurai personally many times over the years and that part of what makes CTF so fun is the community of people you both compete with and against (or both!).

Bool  21:28
Hey Jordan, yeah that's a good commentary
21:29
we are busy trying to apply these updates at the moment
21:29
feels a bit like the first challenge of the ctf!

Jordan Wiens  21:30
Heh. challenge -1. I might use that as a joke on stream. :wink:  Good luck.

You guys know we're releasing transcripts of the team channels right?

Jymbolia  13:56
*now

Bool  14:03
lol

Bool  14:26
suspect we've been battling a cosmos version issue when running on remote
14:26
I guess the op1 box wasn't updated with the latest stuff from wednesday?

Bool  14:33
totally want a bonus point for reporting .viminfo :wink:

Jymbolia  14:37
+1 cool points. May be redeemed for future GIFs.

Bool  14:51
what happens if your solution to challenge 1 doesn't work for us?

Bool  14:58
We think the intended solution is to simply ssh -X into op1@cosmos7, send the UART_TO_CI ENABLE_TELEMETRY command while we are within the window.
14:59
This is working locally
14:59
fails on remote

0x20guy  15:04
You have not solved the challenge

fuzyll:satellite:  15:58
@Bool an astronaut was deployed to look at your satellite and we believe it has now been fixed
15:58
please let us know if that doesn't appear to be the case

Bool  15:59
yay
15:59
we just got telemetry

wilhelm  15:59

After re-running the same commands we were sending before and earlier today (while in window both times)...

Bool  16:00
yeah, ouch.

Bool  16:09
we had it and then it was lost

Bool  16:17
yeah, we think things are broken again
