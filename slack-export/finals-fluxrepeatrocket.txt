@dezk - sorry to be the bad cop but each team is limited to two people.  Team leader and one other.

o/ Hi folks. I’m a part of the production team doing some video coverage throughout the event. I expect ya’ll will be too busy playing to watch but I wanted to offer each team the chance to list any facts about themselves that might not be in the existing bio sheets that I can use when talking about each team on stream if they can think of anything.
In the case of fluxrepeatrocket I was thinking of mentioning how many teams in the CTF community both organize and play in different competitions and mention hack.lu.

We can connect and ping 10.100.4.10! :+1:

Amanda from NY  08:25
@dezk - we need to clean up the members on this channel - which person are you keeping?  @Sceptic, @Manf, or @rugo

dezk  08:26
Yeah sorry, a bit busy here trying to setup the satellite, @rugo can stay.

Sceptic  08:26
left finals-fluxrepeatrocket along with Manf.

rugo  10:48
Hi, our connection to vpn drops often and is really slow
10:48
Is that our fault?

rugo  10:57
We have 80% packet loss

Jymbolia  10:57
pushed a fix
10:57
sorry. others were experiencing similar
10:59
status?

rugo  10:59
Its not really better
10:59
Around 70% loss

Jymbolia  11:00
kk. looking
11:04
I am seeing stale connections that are still natted. can you reconnect your mac ending in e8
11:05
or I can bounce it :wink:

rugo  11:06
bounce
11:06
We got admin on the webserver
11:07
Is that chal0, should we get points?

Jymbolia  11:07
congrats
11:07
woot
11:07
scoring is working correctly

rugo  11:13
We still have around 50% packet loss

Jymbolia  11:21
tun is rock solid on our end. I will dig some more to see if I can find a dial to turn

We have this problem from different locations/networks we tested

Jymbolia  12:20
I changed your keepalive to 10 120.
12:20
what version ovpn are you using?

rugo  12:41
lol, after trying to break out of QEMU, we noticed .bash_history :zipper_mouth_face:

Jymbolia  12:45
congrats

fuzyll:satellite:  12:47
yeah, the game is hack a satellite, not hack your way out of a web server VM :stuck_out_tongue: glad you found it eventually :slightly_smiling_face:

rugo  13:01
Packet loss dropped to 50%, but still high :disappointed:
13:05
Should 10.100.4.2 be directly reachable from our openvpn side/our client?
13:07
Maybe we have a bug in our network config, or is it intentional that we cant talk to 10.100.4.2 directly?
13:08
have to go via 10.100.4.5 or 4.70? Both work, but no direct connection from us to 10.100.4.2. (edited)

Jymbolia  13:41
You do not have a network problem on 2.

rugo  13:48
ok thx

Jymbolia  13:51
no worries.  GLHF

dezk  15:13
Is it intended that the cosmos configuration on 10.100.4.5 does not get any response back? Currently using x11 forwarding.

0x20guy  15:25
Not sure what you mean by no responses back

dezk  15:29
We're sending the enable telemetry command or the radio conmand and we're not getting anything back.

rugo  15:31
We run cosmos on 10.100.4.5. We have an X11 tunneling, so we can remote control cosmos on 10.100.4.5. But we do not get any responses from 10.100.4.2, which is the peer listed in COSMOS's config.

0x20guy  15:32
Read the finals-2020 chat

rugo  15:34
Thanks. But we do not get anything back from the Radio command. We thought we would get a counter until there is a communication window...
15:35
2020/08/07 21:34:15.033  INFO: cmd("RADIO CONFIG with HEADER 'RSC:', RATE LOW, POWER HIGH")

Jymbolia  15:36
hold please

rugo  15:57
Can you tell us this: If we use Cosmos on 10.100.4.5 and send RADIO CONFIG command with RATE = LOW and POWER = HIGH. Should we get anything back? Because we are not getting anything from the radio. Should we get a counter?

rugo  16:06
We don't think our sat works properly
16:06
We have never sent many commands
16:06
Our connection is too horrible anyways

fuzyll:satellite:  16:07
what about it does not seem to be working? (e.g. is this more than just the question you asked earlier? or..?)

rugo  16:08
Yes, thats still the question
rugo
Can you tell us this: If we use Cosmos on 10.100.4.5 and send RADIO CONFIG command with RATE = LOW and POWER = HIGH. Should we get anything back? Because we are not getting anything from the radio. Should we get a counter?

fuzyll:satellite:  16:10
you should be receiving a telemetry packet back
16:15
we're deploying a high-precision catapault to correct the course of your satellite - stand by

fuzyll:satellite:  16:24
we believe all systems are nominal now...let us know if you have any additional issues
16:27
if you guys haven't seen the recent messages in #finals-2020, please take a moment to review them :heart:

fuzyll:satellite:  16:31
set the channel topic: Team 4

rugo  16:51
OK, we finally received telemetry in our webapp
16:51
I guess the task gets us 0 points by now
16:51
Can we still see if we "passed" the task?
16:54
Also, I think out puma forwarded died. Can we restart it?

rugo  17:42
Ok, we got that it starts with cosmos
17:43
So did we do what were supposed to do in chal1?
17:43
Just so we know

0x20guy  17:43
It's in the main chat
17:43
How to solve it

rugo  17:45
Yeah so e solved it, but https://finals.2020.hackasat.com/ doesnt say so

vito  17:45
yeah, we’re querying for the data to update that

rugo  17:54
Didn't understand that response. Ok, we'll continue on to the next task. Our webapp is full of telemetry.

fuzyll:satellite:  17:56
we score challenge completion off of things we're monitoring, but we're a bit behind on filling in challenge 1 completions (since it no longer has a non-zero score)

dezk  18:37
Hey @vito, I have reset my password for the quals, can you update it for the on-orbit challenge login?

vito  18:37
yeah
18:39
pm

dezk  06:07
We have sent the PL_IF_POWER_ON command and now our local satellite's power regulators power cycles, any guidance for this? We think its the FPGA/Pi Board. We are not entirely sure if the PL_IF_POWER_ON command was the culprit but that was the only thing we changed.
06:11
Ah, fixed it, was a short on a solder point under the FPGA/Pi C&DH board...

rugo  07:12
Is the point decreese counter  paused? If so, is the challenge 2 still worth points?

Jymbolia  07:53
Sorry guys, organizers are just waking up.  Nice find on the short.  That was probably my fault :white_frowning_face:. I think we will make an announcement about points and decay this morning, if we haven't already.

rugo  08:47
Hey, are you aware that the systems are still reachable for us? Are we allowed to act on that and continue doing things on the boxes?

Deadwood  09:06
satellites and ground stations are offline.

rugo  09:08
Ah OK, so we wouldnt get an answer if we used cosmos on 10.100.4.5

Deadwood  09:10
correct.  You can talk but no one is listening.

We're really having trouble starting the app on our satellite.
Always getting the Error "Cannot start app RC:C4000004".

dezk  17:26
and apparently we are unable to upload any files, we also tried deleting files but that didn't work
17:27
This is the error message we are receiving Incoming trans 0.21_16 CANCELLED,CondCode FILESTORE_ERR,dest /cf/skeleton_vanilla_app.obj

dezk  18:07
We're kind of lost here... The toolchain does not really work for us locally or remote and we cannot upload anything anymore.

dezk  18:19
@vito we DO want ground power

Amanda from NY  14:47
Oooooo and I'll be sending your team these beauties. We’ll throw in extra quals coins so everyone on your team gets one.
