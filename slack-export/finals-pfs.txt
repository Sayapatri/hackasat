o/ Hi folks. I’m a part of the production team doing some video coverage throughout the event. I expect ya’ll will be too busy playing to watch but I wanted to offer each team the chance to list any facts about themselves that might not be in the existing bio sheets that I can use when talking about each team on stream if they can think of anything.
In the case of PFS if you have no objection I may mention how small of a community the CTF scene is and how between the overlap of colleges and places of work you can often trace lineages between many different teams and how I didn’t even realize I shared connections to some of the folks on the team until after the event. (Without disclosing any exact relationships)

nafod  23:05
sup jordan and everyone else. yeah it is a small world haha. I don't know what's on the bio sheet already but we're totally cool with mentioning that stuff
23:06
explaining the interconnections between top US ctf teams will look a little like the pepe silvia map from it's always sunny

hey, we were able to connect and ping that IP
08:02
so all is well

nafod  12:58
hello, we have received points for challenge 1
12:58
is there something we are missing regarding challenge 0 on the scoreboard
12:58
or should we await further challenges

vito  13:27
https://finals.2020.hackasat.com/
13:27
challenge 0 is a 50-point challenge
13:27
the scoreboard with the little pips doesn’t know that

Deadwood  13:27
your points are being updated

nafod  13:27
updated how?
13:28
and makes sense re:pips, thank you

Deadwood  13:28
reflecting your solve of challenge 0 and challenge 1

nafod  13:28
ah ok, thank you

Deadwood  13:31
your points are accurate.  you have points for both challenge 0 and 1.

nafod  13:31
great, thanks. my main confusion was just surrounding the scoreboard pips, but it makes sense now
13:31
much appreciated

nafod  13:57
hello, could you clarify the scoring re: poland can into space
13:57
I think they solved it >30 minutes after us based on when I sent my message, but they also got 200 points

vito  13:58
noted

nafod  16:27
hello - my teammates want me to ask: when we move in front of the sun, we appear to spin and throw our yaw off, but we appear to otherwise track. is this our mistake?

fuzyll:satellite:  16:28

0x20guy  16:46
I'll post the answer in the main chat

nafod  16:46
thanks

vito  17:21

nafod  11:33
can you check on our satellite? it seems unresponsive

Jymbolia  11:35
sending hard light hologram to look

fuzyll:satellite:  11:35
(these holograms are pretty expensive - we'll send you a bill later :wink:)

nafod  11:35
:dollar:

Jymbolia  11:36
good news is you get to keep the hologram... bad news is you have to go get it.  its only a few hundred Kilometres away.
11:36
:arrow_up: that way.

meenmachine  11:37
The trained monkey asked for a pay raise so we replaced him.
11:39
Should be looking good now!

nafod  11:39

Considerthelion  11:39
cool holograms. how many monkeys does it take to screw in a satellite, yea know. thanks

Jymbolia  11:39
don't thank us, thank the hologram.

meenmachine  11:40
2 monkeys. @Jymbolia and @meenmachine (edited)

nafod  12:27
hey sorry, any chance it could be reset again... we promise to not throw this payload again :stuck_out_tongue:

Jymbolia  12:29
attempting to ping pong space debris at your sat to gently poke it.

nafod  18:18

Considerthelion  18:57

Considerthelion  13:34

nafod  13:35

Considerthelion  13:50

Amanda from NY  14:53
Did your team get enough Quals coins?
14:53
I think i threw "14" in the box.

nafod  15:01
yeah I believe we got 14 (edited)
15:01
yeah, 14 coins and 14 shirts

Amanda from NY  15:07
so you have enough quals coins?

nafod  15:11
hah, if you're offering, we have 15 players so one person missed out. but I think we got the max we could

Amanda from NY  15:15
yup i will send you one more

nafod  15:15
awesome, thank you

Considerthelion  15:22
how long does it take to make a 501c3

Amanda from NY  15:22
No clue...but I can hold your payment until you’re ready
15:22
I think the AF is “good for it” ;)

Considerthelion  15:22
also, can I chat with a chal maker about chal4 some time?

Amanda from NY  15:23
Yeah ping us again in two weeks...these guys are taking a MUCH needed vacation

Considerthelion  15:24
fair
15:24
really impressively how smoothly you all ran this. and the engagement especially for it being remote. loved the sat orbit room

inukai  09:05
was added to finals-pfs by nafod.

nafod  09:05
hey @Amanda from NY, for handling the prize money, we were wondering if it would be possible to change who the money is sent to (instead of me)
09:05
sorry for 9am slack ping, lol

Amanda from NY  09:17
Yup!  It won’t be a problem as long as they have a SSN/tax ID.  Or if you set up an LLC we can send it there if you have a tax ID set up for that.

nafod  09:22
ok sweet, that sounds good! how should we send that SSN/tax id info to you?

Amanda from NY  09:23
Yup...if you want to split it into two or three different communications methods that’s good too. You send the first 3 digits here.  The second two via email and the last four via text or signal if you want
09:24
Or you could password protect a PDF...or usps the form.  Doesn’t matter to me as long as we can get you guys paid
